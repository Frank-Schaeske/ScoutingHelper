## ScoutingHelper

ScoutingHelper helps people interested in football to scout players in the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga. The tool provides statistics on individual players, which can be saved in a player list together with your own comments. Position-related rankings can also be created.

ScoutingHelper was the Capstone Project of my Web Development Bootcamp at neuefische.
